# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This README was moved to `docs/duplicates/admin.README.duplicate.md` because it was an exact duplicate of `frontend/README.md`.

If you landed here looking for the admin README, please review the duplicate copy in:

	- `docs/duplicates/admin.README.duplicate.md`

Or view the canonical frontend README:

	- `frontend/README.md`

If you'd like me to restore a trimmed/admin-specific README, tell me what sections to include and I will create one.
